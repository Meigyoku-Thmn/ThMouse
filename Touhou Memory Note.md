## Remark

From Touhou 6 to Touhou 9.5, ZUN used 640x480 as logical graphics coordinate.

But for some reasons, in Touhou 10, he used 64000x48000 instead, but scaled down by the factor 0.01 (1/100) then reupscaled to window size when rendering (I'm discussing about sprite positions, not about texture's resolutions).

From Touhou 11, he changed to 81920x61440 and factor 0.0078125 (1/128).

That means in all cases, the real logical graphics coordinate is still 640x480.

Maybe because floating-point type is inaccurate but DirectX still needs floating-point type, so he just made an integer type wrapper over it and maintained the real logical graphics coordinate till the time this note was written.
